# 👋 I'm Adrian Avendano

Building at the intersection of **cognition, culture, and code** — exploring how technology reshapes human attention and connection.  

This space is my lab of **open projects, prototypes, and thought experiments** on how tools evolve into extensions of thought itself.

### 🌍 About  
Entrepreneur, connector, and hacker-journalist with 15+ years in tech.  
I’ve founded five companies, traveled through 85+ countries, and lived in 20 — from Seoul and Berlin to Tbilisi and Mexico City.  
Each city has been a neural node in a long experiment on how environment shapes innovation.  

In 2014, I launched **[PeopleHunt](https://www.macworld.com/article/224023/5-apps-for-making-friends-in-a-new-city.html)** — named by *MacWorld* as one of the **Top 5 apps** for making friends in new cities, backed by **Enterprise Ireland** and **StartupChile**.  

Founder of **GST**, a global tech community spanning 45 cities and 135+ gatherings.  
Creator of **Bridging Edges**, where 65+ tech leaders shared insights on how culture, economics, and technology collide.

**[Agent-A](https://agenta.chat/sixmodels)** — multi-agent AI platform where six AI models collaborate, debate, and create — exploring collective intelligence in real time.
